Maternal Health Risk Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict maternal health risk levels using machine learning to assist in reducing maternal mortality and improving health outcomes.
The application aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being by leveraging data analytics to identify high-risk pregnancies.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Scales numerical features and encodes categorical variables for improved model accuracy.
- Modeling: Uses Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, combined through stacking to enhance prediction performance.
- Evaluation: Provides comprehensive metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess model effectiveness.
- Model Saving: Saves trained models and preprocessing objects for deployment and future use.
